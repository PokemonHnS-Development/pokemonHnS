# Pokémon Heart & Soul
Pokémon Heart & Soul brings the classic Johto Region and its iconic story to the world of modern GBA decomp hacking. Built on the Modern Emerald decomp, this project offers a fresh take on the GSC/HGSS experience, blending key aspects of the Gen 2 and Gen 4 games, while incorporating many modern QoL features, as well as some familiar Gen 3 mechanics. Not only is Heart & Soul (HnS) a first-of-its-kind, fully completed, playtested, and largely faithful GSC remake / HGSS demake, it's also completely open source, and is intended to be a base for a new generation of Johto rom hacks.

## Developer's Note: 
Development for this project was primarily (95%) a solo-effort that consumed almost all of my free time for the last year. I am not a professional programmer, but I did my best to make the game that I wanted to play. If you'd like to improve, expand upon, or make your own version of HnS, feel free to take advantage of the open source! Please direct any questions to the [Heart & Soul Discord](https://discord.gg/KmuvXJrS9M). I hope you enjoy!

### Setting Expectations:
- Heart & Soul was designed as a traditional Pokémon experience, akin to the main-series games. It is not a difficulty hack, and does not have built-in features for non-traditional playstyles. Do not expect to see features like infinite rare candies, or built-in randomization or nuzlocking rules. 
- Heart & Soul stands on the shoulders of giants. I am not an artist or a professional programmer, so much of the art and some of the code for this project was drawn from open source assets. I did my best to credit all sources below and in the game credits, but if you find any that I missed, please let me know in the [Heart & Soul Discord](https://discord.gg/KmuvXJrS9M).
- Heart & Soul has been rigorously playtested, (shoutout to the playtesters) but there still may be some small bugs. If you find any, please report them to the [Heart & Soul Discord](https://discord.gg/KmuvXJrS9M).
- There are a few GSC/HGSS features that were too complex or time consuming for me to implement in this project. See differences section below.

### Differences from GSC/HGSS:
- Radio is a standalone Key Item with limited functionality instead of a menu in the Pokégear
- Trainers will not offer their phone numbers, no way to rematch them
- Level curve is greatly improved
- Apricorns replaced with berries, berry ball catch boost is based on Type
- Strength boulder-in-hole puzzles replaced with Emerald Mach Bike puzzles
- No itemfinder and no hidden items
- Only 50 TMs (The ones from emerald)
- Swarms are replaced with a 5% Hoenn encounter on each route in Kanto
- Mom does not take your money
- No unique Kanto battle music for trainers and gym leaders, only Johto
- Ruins of alph back room requirements are slightly altered
- No pokéathalon dome
- No Battle Frontier
- Yes Battle Tower (ported straight from emerald, not extensively tested so be careful)
- No trades in Kanto

## Future Plans
I plan to take a step back from this project once the initial wave of inevitable post-release bugs are fixed. Over the course of the playtest, the dev team has grown from 1 to 6, and an effort to port the whole project to pokeemerald expansion is underway. For more concrete plants, join the [discord](https://discord.gg/KmuvXJrS9M)!

## Credits
<small>Special thanks to the playtesters and devs who joined me late in development. Their work greatly improved the stability and quality of HnS. They inspired me to add new features for all of you to enjoy, and they made the whole process way more fun. HnS would be a mess without them.</small>

# For Developers
If you are a developer interested in forking this repository and making your own modifications to Heart & Soul, you may want to read up on the base that was used, Modern Emerald. Information on that project, and pret's Pokéemerald decompilation project, continue reading below!
- Note: This project is not yet compatible with Porymap 6. Use Porymap 5 instead.
- Also Note: devkitARM version 65 or older is required.

## Pokémon Modern Emerald 

This project is based on the decompilation of Pokémon Emerald, edited to be "Pokémon Modern Emerald".
You can get more information about Modern Emerald by resetes12 at [Pokécommunity](https://www.Pokécommunity.com/showthread.php?t=494005) and at [Github](https://github.com/resetes12/Pokéemerald).

## If you want to compile:

Please follow [Pret's guide on how to build the rom](https://github.com/pret/Pokéemerald/blob/master/INSTALL.md) but using this branch instead of theirs. 
When you compile, use the modern compiler with "make modern". Compiling using the old compiler won't work.
